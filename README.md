# SQL-Finance-organization-project

 A new finance organisation has been started and is having initial organisational problems related to loan processing with customers not knowing where to approach for loans. The staffs also are not properly trained on where the loan documents should be processed. To tackle this issue, new business rules are created. The staffs are also informed about how they will work and deal with the customers. This project is part of pre-masters semester of data analytics and AI course which I did in Nov-Dec 2024.
